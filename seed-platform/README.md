# S.E.E.D. — Social Emotional Early Detection

**AI-powered early ASD screening platform for Indian children aged 2–5.**

> ⚠️ **Screening tool only. Not a diagnostic instrument. Clinical confirmation required.**

## Stage 1 — What's Built

| Module | Status |
|---|---|
| Docker Compose (postgres, redis, backend, frontend, analysis-engine) | ✅ |
| Prisma schema — full SEED data model | ✅ |
| Auth: register, login, refresh, logout, verify-email, me | ✅ |
| Clinician invite-code generation + parent validation (DPDPA-2023) | ✅ |
| JWT + refresh token with Redis blacklisting + rotation | ✅ |
| Database seed — admin, 2 clinicians, 4 parents, 8 children | ✅ |
| Indian normative baselines — 7 age groups × 5 metrics | ✅ |
| Frontend auth pages — login, register, verify-email | ✅ |
| FastAPI analysis engine — feature_engineer, scorer, video_analyzer | ✅ |
| Risk tier system — MONITOR / INDETERMINATE / ELEVATED (LOW absent) | ✅ |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start all services
docker compose up --build

# In a second terminal — run migrations and seed
docker compose exec backend npm run db:migrate
docker compose exec backend npm run db:seed
```

## Architecture

```
seed-platform/
├── frontend/          React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind + Phaser 3
├── backend/           Node/Express + TypeScript + Prisma + Redis
├── analysis-engine/   FastAPI + XGBoost + MediaPipe Face Mesh
└── docker-compose.yml
```

### Data flow

```
Parent registers (with clinician invite code)
  → Child profile created
  → Screening session initiated
  → Game (Phaser 3) events streamed
  → Bull queue job dispatched to FastAPI (port 8001)
  → Feature extraction → XGBoost scoring → Risk tier
  → Socket.io progress → Results displayed with disclaimer
  → Clinician review + optional override
```

## Key Design Decisions

### Risk tiers
`MONITOR` / `INDETERMINATE` / `ELEVATED` — **`LOW` is deliberately absent.**
The system never definitively clears a child. Single-metric divergence (>2 SD below norm)
overrides the composite score to `INDETERMINATE` minimum.

### DPDPA-2023 compliance
Children's health data requires clinician prescription gating under Schedule IV.
Implemented via clinician-generated invite codes that parents must use to register.

### Model honesty
No clinical validation study has been conducted. Any accuracy or AUC figures
that appear in documentation or comments are placeholders — they are not based
on a real cohort study. All normative baselines are marked `[APPROXIMATE]`
and must be replaced with India-collected data before any clinical use.
A formal validation study on an adequately sized, representative Indian cohort
is required before this system is used in any clinical or research setting.
