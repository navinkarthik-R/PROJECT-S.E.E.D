            S.E.E.D. (Social Emotional Early Detection) is a developmental screening
            platform operated by Team Jarvis ("we", "us", "our"). The platform is
            designed to assist qualified healthcare professionals in the early
            identification of developmental concerns in children aged 18 months to
            5 years. S.E.E.D. is a screening support tool and does not provide
            medical diagnoses.
